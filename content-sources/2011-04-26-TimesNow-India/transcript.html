 WikiLeaks
chief Julian Assange in an explosive revelation to TIMES NOW's Editor-in-Chief
Arnab Goswami on Swiss bank data, said there are Indian names in the Swiss bank
list that is going to be made public. He noted that he has come to know through
a report that there are more Indian deposits in the Swiss banks than any other
nationality. Crusader Assange claims that India foolishly aped US Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton in questioning the authenticity of the cables. He further
said the Indian government's response to the expose was one of the worst in the
world.

 The Julian Assange
Interview
</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
 
Mr. Assange, first of all, it is an absolute pleasure. You are an icon of
journalism. People look up to you. I do not know if you are aware, what
WikiLeaks has been doing through the India cables, has been making a lot of news
in India, especially over the last 45 odd days. Have you been following
that?
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN ASSANGE:
</span>
  Yes, we
have been following that and we are of course extremely proud. This is what we
all wanted and hoped in our work, to see this kind of effect. Perhaps we have
seen a similar level of effect in the Middle East but really the spectrum of
material that is coming out in India is exactly what we hoped for. So far there
have been 21 front pages of “The Hindu” and of course the material
has played out in many other ways in the Indian media.

<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
  Is it important
to you that these cables have an impact? Because you put out these cables in the
raw sense of it. There is no interpretation to it. Do you really look forward to
a certain impact? For example, in the case of
India?
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN ASSANGE:
</span>
  Well,
what we promised our sources is that we will try to get the maximum possible
political impact for what they are doing. Perhaps you remember people who are
coming to us are sometimes coming to us with great risk, with incarceration,
persecution or execution. So we represent them like a lawyer represents a client
to a court. We represent whistle blowers to the public and what we are trying to
do is make sure the efforts they go through have the biggest possible impact.
Our activity is sort of geared and structured around that way and that means
very specific deals with the different media around the world, promoting things
ourselves, doing interviews like this one to try and raise the level, the
credibility of the material that we get.

<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
  Those who get
hurt by the publication of your cables read motives. For example, in the context
of India... the India cables primarily which have come out so far ... at least
the first part of it ... were seen to be completely anti-American and also
exposing members of the Indian political establishment who are too eager to
please the Americans. Can a motive be read
there?
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN ASSANGE:
</span>
  What
we do is provide people with the truth. Now that is not our interpretation of
the truth. It is very interesting. We are in both in extremely difficult
position; we take information which has the maximum possible censorship on it.
If you look at their reaction, to our spy by the Pentagon, the State Department,
the CIA... we have our own publicly declared CIA Task Force into us. Of course,
it is difficult to publish that kind of information, on the other hand, we have
structured things in such a way that we also have a journalistically easy job,
that is either the material we are publishing is a legitimate government
document or corporate document or it is not. What is inside the documents in
terms of its contents ... what the State Department is saying about India ...
about other Ambassadors ... or what a banking organization is saying about its
clients, that is an internal matter that journalists still have to check over
... crawl over and the public itself to understand what that means for a country
... what the allegation means. But for us things are relatively easy. We just
say is this a true document, is this a false document ... now that is a black
and white decision for us. So we are able to deal with this hard case of
publishing material that Super powers do not like in part because the
journalistic part of understanding is something true or false is very very
simple.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
  Let me
just step back a little, Mr. Assange. What did you set out to do when you
started this whole journey? What really was the driving factor that you
had?
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN ASSANGE:
</span>
  Since
the early 1990s, I have been involved in publishing things that have been
difficult to publish and I understood that bringing the Internet to people ...
bringing information to people, educating people about how their world actually
works tends to make the world more just and so like the other individuals I want
to live in a just place. And when I see something around me that is unjust or
inhuman I feel the world around me is not a pleasant place for me to live in. So
I wanted to take these things that I had done and learnt from ... some of my
political understanding, my technical understanding and the contacts that I had
made in human rights work, photography, intelligence agencies, journalism and
pool them all together and solve what I saw as the biggest problem that I could
solve which was people not knowing how political and corporate institutions in a
modern era actually behave. Because we need to understand how they actually
behave if we are to deal with them. And in the end it really is these
institutions that control very large parts of our lives and the directions that
human civilization is moving in. I see that there are three types of history and
all our work as a civilization is based on these three types. So one is
information that has an economy behind it. Some of that is extremely important
information such as how to pump water, how to create penicillin... very very
important human information but they exist and there exists an industry around
that. The other is information which people no longer care about. Books
published years ago, perhaps the information is important but there is no
industry around it. On the other hand, no one is trying to destroy the
information either. Then there is a third class of information which is
information from within major institutions, that people are actively trying to
suppress from the public. That type of information is something we have never
really known before ... that human civilization has never really known ... going
back all the way to ancient Greece we have never really known before because
people have been working to keep it away from the public. And why do they work
to keep it away from the public? Because they believe it will do something if
the public knows. What will it do? Well, the public will take it and reform
those institutions. If we want accountable, just human institutions, then we
need to understand in all the ways in which they are into being accountable , in
which they are not being just and once we have this understanding, then we can
both address specifically individual acts of injustice but we can also get a
feeling for how they behave as a whole ... about of systems of patronage work,
systems of bureaucracy, international geo politics and I say until we can
understand how these systems work there cannot possibly be a political
prescription or a philosophical prescription into fixing those problems. So to
that extent, all existing political philosophies are bankrupt because they are
built on not understanding how human institutions actually behave in a modern
era. We have to first understand how our institutions behave before we can come
up with programs to reform them.
<br></div>
<div class="Normal" style="  text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES
NOW:
</span>
  Isn’t the definition for what is just and unjust a very
subjective thing?
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN
ASSANGE:
</span>
  No, I do not think this is subjective at all. I mean when we
look at children around the world playing with toys ... one child is playing
with a toy and the other larger child comes and takes the toy away, there is a
feeling within the child that that was unjust. Similarly when people arbitrarily
kill there is a feeling it is unjust. Now I say and evidence shows that in
general around the world the feeling of what is just and unjust is actually
pretty common. It is only when we get to the more complex and ornate cases that
people start to differ and when we start to build up some kind of intellectual
construct on these feelings of injustice but the basic feeling of injustice that
if one person is full and another person is starving and they are sitting side
by side that is unjust, that is something that is common amongst many many
people. 
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
  When you
were 16 you started off with hacking and it was under the name of which meant
‘nobly untruthful’. Can you just explain that, what you meant by
‘nobly untruthful’ and you have a name to your group which was
‘international subversives’, that sounds extremely dangerous. What
were you setting out to do
then?
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN ASSANGE:
</span>
  We were
teenagers trying to understand the world within the international context,
actually but especially from within Australia which is fairly isolated. This is
pre-Internet. What we were trying to understand how these big systems work,
challenge them, find things that were unjust. I run a magazine from that and we
ended up being prosecuted as a result of that magazine. It took about six years
in court to get out of that. The ‘nobly untruthful’ is just a
play-up. If you use a pseudonym, it is
just
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>
 a sort of clever play on
the Latin words. 
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
 
I want to ask you a few questions in the context of India. I do not know how
much you have been following what has been happening in India, Mr Assange, but
we had a series of scams. Now every time – and people like to know your
views on this – every time there is a scam, the government sort of steps
in or whoever is affected steps in and tackles that issue in what is seen to be
a piecemeal way. It is more damage control. You know handle one scam at one
time, put it up to some process of enquiry, ensure it is away from constant
media attention. In your view how long will this sort of approach
last.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN ASSANGE:
</span>
  I am
not sure. When we started releasing these cables about India we showed two
things. One is what was actually in the material ... the various scandals that
have come out, relations with the US, the bribing in Parliament and so on. The
other thing we revealed is the government’s reaction to all that was;
Prime Minister Singh’s reaction to all that was and other peoples. So we
can see two types of information and both of these are quite important to
understand how these organizations are actually behaving. So I agree with you,
the response by the government left a lot to be desired. I said before it was
clear to me Prime Minister Singh was deliberately attempting to mislead the
people on what type of material this was. People tell me that he is not
personally corrupt. I do not know myself. I do not have any information on
whether he is or is not but his reaction left a lot to be desired. It
wasn’t to fully, frankly investigate what is going on and then provide the
findings to the Parliament; rather it was an attempt to spin the issue and I
suspect that has come from experience in dealing with similar scandals in the
past. That is a way you can deal with them by trying to spin them than authorize
and investigation or a response. If we are to have a strong response from the
government, it will require a strong response from the media. They just have to
be pushed and pushed and pushed until they see that there is an advantage in
performing a proper response. That’s what will drive these people. I mean
I understand from running an institution which is constantly under attack from
state activists and from critics that you do try and put out the biggest fire
first. So the absence of the Indian government to comprehensively respond
doesn’t necessarily mean that they will not or that they have all sorts of
vested interests in trying to shirk the issue. A large part of it is that they
have many fires to put out like all big institutions and so they simply put out
the biggest fire they can and then they turn their concentration to the small
ones. So if you want the Indian government to really address corruption then it
must become the central issue of the nation. So it cannot simply give the small
concessions of a small investigation or push something off to a parliamentary
committee and that actually seems like it may be on the cards.

<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
  But Mr Assange,
everyone responded. Everyone in the Government began to say just one thing...
“Do you expect the Government of India to respond to WikiLeaks Paper? Do
you expect us to take these cables seriously?” I mean at the end of the
day, the description was that this was just diplomatic garble. It means
nothing...It is unverifiable beyond a point. It is one person’s opinion
and Governments can’t respond to what is seen to be the opinion of one
person or a conversation that they called hearsay. . I want to know what you
sense of that kind of response...that this is not serious matter...It is not
legally verifiable matter. And hence we do not need to respond to this...That
was the response to it.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN
ASSANGE:
</span>
  That was a clear attempt to mislead the Indian nation on what
the cables were. And I said that at that time that I find that quite disturbing.
We have dealt with over 60 different countries in relation to things we have
released related to the cables we have released and the Indian
Government’s response was one of the worst in the world to the
information.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
  Why?
Could you explain that?
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN
ASSANGE:
</span>
  Well the other countries that have come out have said,
“Well on that particular issue revealed by the cables, we say we had a
defence. So it is not quite as bad as it seems. Or we did something else,
something like this....” But there was no questioning whether the cables
themselves were legitimate and needed to be responded to. Part of what is going
on in India I think is that Hillary Clinton back in December went around to many
countries including India and said, “Look, certain things might be coming
out and here’s how I want you to respond to them.” And what Hillary
was doing and what the State Department has being doing is saying we refuse to
confirm or deny them...We won’t talk about leaked things ever. And I
suspect the Indian government rather foolishly, when the cables came out,
decided they would ape her and play her line which has been very unsuccessful in
the US as way of responding to the material. And other countries to their
credit, have not decided to go down the line recommended by Hillary in refusing
to talk about anything in the cables. But rather have fully engaged with what
the allegations were and that is what the Indian Government needs to do...fully
engage with what the allegations are. These cables have not been questioned at
all. There is an ongoing prosecution in fact into us, into an alleged source,
Bradley Manning...FBI investigations, CIA taskforce etc. The best journalists in
the world have worked on this material and published thousands of articles on
it. There is no doubt that what is in the cables is correct to the degrees that
that is what American diplomats wrote. That is what they sent back to
Washington. 
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
  Mr.
Assange, when you say that Hillary Clinton went around...Is it just your
assessment? Is this... you’re connecting the dots there? Or do you have
some information that Hillary Clinton could have coached the Indian Government
preemptively about what their response should
be?
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN ASSANGE:
</span>
  I have
read that Hillary Clinton and members of the State Department did approach the
Indian Government in this matter and we know they were doing that with dozens of
Governments. And the large Government received protocols either from Hillary
Clinton or Barack Obama or Joseph Biden. Who in the State Department spoke to
the Indian Government , I’m not sure about. But I understand it is
admitted that the Indian Government was approached by the United States back in
December.
<br></div>
<div class="Normal" style="  text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES
NOW:
</span>
  Have you been following the Anna Hazare movement? The movement for a
Lokpal Bill, an Ombudsman Bill. Have you been following the fast of Anna Hazare.
You made some comments about it recently in your interview to the Hindu. What do
you think about it?
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN
ASSANGE:
</span>
  It is extremely interesting that the Indian Government has said
it will respond to the demands within 5 days. So that must show the level of
support by the Indian population, by the Indian media. Of course when the
Government says it will do something that doesn’t mean it will actually
implement it. It requires constant pressure to make sure it is implemented. I
understand now there is an attempt to try and embroil the movement in some kind
of smear campaign against that movement. That is something we are used to as
well. That has been working for many years against us. With our more impactful
material, there is a more aggressive smear campaign. It is quite interesting to
see how these things are completely in proportion. When we publish something
that has incredibly high impact amongst major powers or powerful groups of
powerful companies then we get an attack back that is proportionate o the power
of the publication. Every single time, it is completely predictable. Before
publishing something now, we predict we will have about 2 days before the smear
comes around and they try
and....
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
  So you
anticipate that?
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN
ASSANGE:
</span>
  Yes
absolutely!
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
 
So..
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN ASSANGE:
</span>
  We
can’t always anticipate. You know, we don’t anticipate always the
precise smear. This is too difficult. But we always know we have two days of
initiative after a publication and then the opponents and the supporters will
then turn around and engage in some sort of smear campaign within 48 hours.

<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
  You know the
argument always is, if you attack us with daggers, you don’t expect us to
respond with cottonwool.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN
ASSANGE:
</span>
  Yeah
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES
NOW:
</span>
  That’s what people say. So the Governments under attack are
going to attack you back.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN
ASSANGE:
</span>
  Yes, but we’re not attacking them. We’re just
telling the population the truth. One of our supporters, John Pilger, put it in
quite an interesting way. You know that Governments, including the Indian
Government, are not scared of Wikileaks. The American Government is not scared
of WikiLeaks. The American Government doesn’t care what Julian Assange
knows. It is completely irrelevant. What these Governments care about is what
the audience knows...About what we tell the audience...They are only trying to
attack us because it is a way of attacking the audience. What we know is really
not that important. It is simply one ability to tell everyone else and defy.
With the case of the Pentagon, defy a public demand by the Pentagon to destroy
everything we had previously published and we were going to publish.

<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
  So in a way the
people who would have been at the forefront of the questioning the policies
against corruption or the absence of them in India in an aggressive way...Those
who were at the forefront of the people’s movement should have anticipated
a counter campaign. I just want to ask one small question before I move one.
They attacked you, but they attacked you personally as well. There were personal
charges against you. In the context of some of the members of the movement, the
questions have been about personal integrity, not in terms of character or a
personal issue but financial propriety etc... being part of the same system of
patronage. In your view, is that a serious enough issue? Because on side, you
have an incredibly important cause of eradicating that form of institutional
corruption in India. On the other hand, shouldn’t those who are the office
bearers of that cause be seen to be like Caesar’s wife, above suspicion on
issues of financial integrity and
propriety?
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN ASSANGE:
</span>
 
Everyone should have some scrutiny but the scrutiny has got to be in proportion
and I mean in our case, I will give you a small example. So we called for the
transparency of major powers engaged in war crimes, engaged in Swiss banking
accounts and money laundering, etc. and so one of the counter attacks on us is
to say WikiLeaks as an institution is not transparent
enough.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
  Yes, we
heard that. 
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN ASSANGE:
</span>
 
I mean it is just extraordinary the level that it goes to. For example, the
reality is that we are a small media organization under tremendous attack. We
have a publicly stated CIA Task Force into us. We also as an organization have a
role to protect the identity of our sources. That is one of our primary missions
to protect the identity of our sources. So of course we are not transparent
about who our sources are. Of course we are not transparent about where some of
our servers are. Of course we are not transparent about who some of our
employees are because some of our employees are targeted by agencies. This
should be completely obvious but because we preach that major powers should be
transparent it is then sort of a natural attack by these groups to try and say
well you are not transparent yourself. I mean here I am speaking for the
organization and there is a lot of transparency related to what we do but there
are also areas that we have to protect. So that is a standard rhetorical
technique to throw your opponents’ moral position straight back at them.
The Pentagon for example said that we might have blood on our hands and ran
this. And now, if you look for WikiLeaks on the Internet with blood on its hands
Vs. Pentagon with blood on its hands, you find there are 10 times as many web
pages talking about Wikileaks having blood on its hands as the Pentagon involved
in all its various wars. In fact, nothing we have ever published is even claimed
by any official in any government to have resulted in someone’s death. So,
this standard rhetorical technique of taking the accusation and turn it back on
the person is simply there to distract from the power of the message. In our
case because we produce the original documents that have proven to be true,
proven to be official documents, there is no ability to attack what we publish.
So the only sort of attack we get is on us as people and this case you are
speaking about in India, I am sure that is the same framework. Of course, I do
not if the accusations against these individuals are true or not but I am sure
why these accusations are being made.

<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
  But the other
argument that comes which is also relevant in the context of what you are doing
internationally, especially in America is that in India what they say, what they
have been saying over the last ... I do not know if you are aware but in the
last 10-11 months there has been a series of scams and then there has been the
WikiLeaks publication and parliamentary sessions. Now what we constantly hear
from politicians is that do not undermine our democracy. We have a Parliament,
do not undermine our institutions. If you undermine institutions you will
undermine democracy and that is an argument that is put forth very often
whenever there is a big scam or whenever there is public outrage ... whenever
people come out on the streets ... almost suggesting it is subversive activity.
How do you look at that response? We have seen that response more and more, we
can have a debate but if you are questioning our institutions a red line of your
freedom of expression.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN
ASSANGE:
</span>
  I think Thomas Jefferson had it right – Information is the
life blood of democracy. And the only way to keep institutions strong and clean
is to present factual information on how they are actually behaving. Of course
if the information being presented is untrue, that is a different story. You can
actually corrupt a body politic by putting in lies. But if the information that
is being presented ... for example the information we have presented with The
Hindu in the cable releases ... then this is something that is really keeping
democracy clean in India and keeps these institutions
strong.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
  The
biggest issue in India today is this secrecy in Swiss banks and I am sure you
are aware of the public interest in India about it.  This is a debate that has
been going on for 3 decades. What do you think about it? About these secret
Swiss accounts – I am sure you have heard about the enormous amount of ill
gotten Indian wealth which lies in Swiss banks?

<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN ASSANGE:
</span>
  I have seen
a report from this EU ... as opposed to Swiss ... but an official report that
there are more Indian deposits in Swiss banks than any other nationality. So
that should be a concern. The work I did in Africa I discovered that 3 billion
dollars had been sucked out of Kenya and pushed around the world including into
Swiss banks. And it struck me that this was much worse than just local
corruption because when you have local corruption, when someone steals from a
ministry and puts it into their company in India and spends it in India well,
even if the government is losing money at least the people of India are not
losing the money. But when the money taken is pushed offshore, then every time
someone sends a million dollars to a Swiss Bank, they are buying Swiss Francs
and they are selling rupees and the result is that the currency of the nation is
debased. And so there is a double effect in the corruption. Everything for all
Indians becomes more expensive as a result of that transfer. We ... a few years
ago in 2008, published a series of accounts of Swiss bank account holders in the
Cayeman Islands and the Cayeman Islands was being used across the world to hide
assets and to evade tax. To open one of these bank accounts with a bank like
Julius Baer, the largest private Swiss banking concern, one needed at least a
million dollars. So this is not ... when we speak of banking, here we are not
talking about normal banking and that is a defense these banks often use. They
say, “Oh, you like your bank account to be private, don’t you? This
is just the exact same sort of
thing.”
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
 
Exactly.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN ASSANGE:
</span>
  This
is absolutely not the same kind of a thing. It is wrong to call this banking. It
is something else. It is asset hiding and they use laws in Carribean Islands
like the Cayeman Islands, they use complex structures. It is not anything like a
normal bank account ... The position lawyers
...

 TIMES NOW:
</span>
  Transfer
funds.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN ASSANGE:
</span>
 
Transfer funds all over the place, make sure there is no accessible names, use
secrecy laws etc, and the only reason you would want to be putting your money
into a Swiss bank controlled place like Cayeman Islands is to hide assets. It is
actually quite expensive to do. Looking at the documentation we saw in that
period, it was about 15-25 thousand US Dollars per year just to keep the
account. Why would someone be paying so much money to do that?

<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
  No, but it
happens. There is a cloak and dagger way to it. I do not know if you have heard
of Hasan Ali, India’s biggest tax swindler. He is currently in jail. In
one account itself, he had 8 billion dollars and later when the government went
to find out ... one day there was 60,000 dollars left and the other day, there
was none. So the money had been taken away. Now Mr. Assange, the argument the
Indian government has given so far is that there are rules. There are always two
arguments that governments give. One is national security, and the other is
international rules and protocol. On international rules and protocol they say
there is a double taxation avoidance agreement with Switzerland which we must
respect, with other European countries, we must respect. We cannot break those
rules. But there is a strong view in India that if the governments on both sides
want, they can change the rules. So it is a system of patronage, isn’t
it?
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN ASSANGE:
</span>
  Of
course, they can change it. I mean I had a Swiss bank
account.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
  Really?
How much did you have in it?
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN
ASSANGE:
</span>
  I had a Swiss bank account not with Julius Baer but with the
post office in Switzerland. It also runs bank accounts. And my Swiss bank
account was closed down like that (snaps fingers) as a result of US pressure.
That was a publicly declared bank account designed to raise funds for our legal
defenses. Closed down like this (snaps fingers) as a result within 4 days of
Cablegate. So it is simply not true that these organizations and governments
can’t come up with alternative proposals if they have the will to do
so.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
  So this
argument of double taxation is not something that would apply.

<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN ASSANGE:
</span>
  Double
taxation doesn’t have anything to do with asset hiding. So it
doesn’t  ... simply cover asset hiding. In terms of putting money
offshore, it can cover that but the citizen concerned can’t be Indian. We
had a similar issue in Australia where most of the share owners of the mining
companies were from overseas ... from the US and the dividends were being paid
off to the US. So there was no tax on those dividends and the Australian
government decided it would introduce special tax on the mining companies
because the mining industry was making so much money and the other industries
weren’t. It is completely possible to do. The Australian government
decided to do it although quite interestingly the mining lobby, they all got
together and rolled the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd and put another person in his
place, Julian Gillard and the cables released showed some of the scheming going
on to roll the Prime Minister. So in Australia’s case it was perfectly
possible to do it legally, it wasn’t possible to do it politically. The
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd lost his prime ministership as a
result.

 TIMES
NOW:
</span>
  On the 17
<span style="vertical-align: super;">
 th
</span>
  of January
2011, you had this press conference in which Elmer gave you two discs of data in
front of reporters and he said about the system that the Swiss system runs
exactly what you are saying ... it damages society. And since then Mr. Assange,
people across India have been waiting to know when this information will come
out. It has the potential of correcting one of the greatest ills of our
system.
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN ASSANGE:
</span>
  Well, let
me tell you what has happened in relation to that. Normally, we only deal with
anonymous sources. Mr. Elmer and his legal team for reasons of their own, which
I do not understand, decided to have a public press conference. He then returned
to Switzerland and was immediately imprisoned. While an investigation is taking
place he is still in prison at this moment. He has not as far as I am aware been
charged with anything. He is still simply in prison during the period of
investigation. And we have had an indirect offer through a third party that if
we return what they believe to be the data then they will work to acquit Mr.
Elmer to be free. So my ability to talk about this subject is of course limited
by the fact that the Swiss bank has a hostage.

<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
  So it is a
difficult situation for you. You know the person who have given you the CD is a
hostage and as of now because of that you are being held back from making this
information public. 
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN
ASSANGE:
</span>
  Well I obviously cannot say whether there was information of
those CDS and what sort of information it was. But yes, it is a very difficult
situation for us that he is effectively being held hostage. Let us not forget
that Switzerland...about 50 percent of its GDP comes from backing activities.
The last case we did in 2008 regarding the Swiss bank Julius Baer....they tried
to close us down. They went to a California court. It became a very very big
case. In the end we won and it cost them approx. 300 US million dollars in loss
of profits. They had to cancel their US operations and so on. But Mr. Elmer was
followed around by private investigators- that is fully documented and
proved-paid for by the Swiss banks. It is a difficult
business.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIME S NOW:
</span>
  You
have strong views on it. And I completely appreciate that you can’t talk
about it in detail. But let me ask you more generically, that is your heart, you
would like to reveal the details..in your heart. I am not asking you when and
under what circumstances, but having known about it, you would like to reveal
details of how the system operates, wouldn’t
you?
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN ASSANGE:
</span>
  Well, we
have various types of information about different banking operations in the
world. Over time, we have revealed those. In fact, most of the legal attacks on
us have been from banks. Banks in Scotland...banks in Dubai...banks in Iceland.
We all received legal attacks from these banks. And we will continue publishing
data on these banks as soon as we are able to do so.

<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
  have you
encountered any Indian names? I am not asking you to tell me where, which
banks...
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN ASSANGE:
</span>
  Yes
there are Indian names in the data we have already published or going to
publish. I can’t remember specifically whether there are Indian names in
the upcoming publication. But I have read Indian names. Similarly, in these
private Swiss banking concerns, where you need at least a million
dollars...which is a significant amount of money..Not an average
Indian..
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
  And it is
difficult to identify those names. Anything else you can tell
us?
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULAIN ASSANGE:
</span>
  I
can’t tell you anything more at this stage. As we go through the process
of releasing data, as always we have to do extra research. And once we
understand which media organizations are best placed to help us with that
research, then we operate with them. But we are not at that stage yet that I
know all the research that is going
on.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
  To all our
Indian viewers, just one point. Should they lose hope that the names will come
out at one point.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN
ASSANGE:
</span>
  No
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
 
What would you say to them
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN
ASSANGE:
</span>
  That you should absolutely not lose hope. It is quite
interesting. There is a..There are different forces at play here. The German
Government in particular has been very strong. There needs to be transparency in
banking operations. It has gone so far as to buy CDs off...in Liechtenstein and
so on...To reveal this information. Very, very aggressive approach by the German
Government and the German Government is the dominant power within Europe. SO
those German attitudes are seeping into Europe as a whole. The US has also been
applying pressure in relation to UBS and tax evaders. So the problem is, as
Swiss bank accounts are opened up there are simply other ways to deal with the
situation. So you go and register a trust, in say Charles and then the trust
then goes and opens a  Swiss account while you might own a Swiss bank account,
but what is there is a trust in Charles..Then you have to break that trust in
Charles. That is the problem throughout the offshore sector. That is quite hard
to deal with. In case you get this through regulation, investigation...you kind
of get this at a level that although people can hide their assets in this way,
the amount of expense and effort and risk involved in the asset hiding
doesn’t make it worthwhile.

<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
  Given the
economic and political clout that India wields, any reason that India should not
be as aggressive?
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULAIN
ASSANGE:
</span>
  No. There is no reason why India should not be aggressive. In
fact maybe, it should be more aggressive because India seems like it is losing
per capita much more tax money than
Germany.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
  Mr.
Assange, at the very end, you have become an unlikely journalistic icon. You are
changing the rules of the game. Do you think there will be others like you? Do
you think this form of journalism that you are putting out...you today know..I
wouldn’t want to say sort of copyright..But this form of journalism is
solely identified with you and your movement. Do you think this is a form of
journalism which will change the rules by which the Fourth Estate operates in
the future?
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN ASSANGE:
</span>
 
We have a lot of people who are trying to do similar things now that have been
inspired by us. Mostly, they haven’t gotten anywhere yet. These are very
preliminary stages but we know of about 30 different attempts to do things a
little differently like we are doing. People are concentrating I think wrongly
on the leaking side.  Protecting sources coming in that is very important. It is
only useful if you can publish, so The New York Times is an example. It is going
ahead and trying to build its own sort of system in immediate information. But
the problem is a wide class of information in the New York Times that publish.
So you actually need both of these. Getting information in and getting
information out. But I just earlier today spoke to some people in Kyrgyzstan and
there is a little Kyrgyzstan newspaper very aggressive and for the past one
month inspired by us has been getting in reports of corruption in Kyrgyzstan and
publishing it.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 TIMES NOW:
</span>
  So
there is a Domino effect. Do you think the American government will get
you?
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 JULIAN ASSANGE:
</span>
  I
don’t think so. But only because we have a lot of support. It really is
like that, we have people supporting us, doing a lot in various levels from
demonstrations in the street to just recently .. just yesterday  12 people went
to an Obama fund raiser, paid 5,000 dollars per person, sat at the table and
altogether got up and sung how unhappy they were with the White House’s
treatment of Bradley Manning, our alleged source who is in military prison. That
spectrum of support is what is keeping us strong, is what is keeping these
forces at bay. They are very aggressively trying to get up the case in Virginia.
... that means detaining people many times at the US border, raiding people
around Boston, pulling records from Twitter and presumably Google and Facebook
and all the other companies they can ... it is a conflict situation but we have
the overwhelming numbers ... so we have the overwhelming support of the general
public and most young journalists. And what our opponents have is organization.
So for instance, if the State Department internally is organized.  The FBI
internally is very well organized. Our supporters in the world is numerous but
not very well organized. As time goes by they are becoming more and more
organized. They are meeting each other, making connections with each other. They
are finding each other and starting to work out what they can do. For example,
this event that occurred at the Obama fund raiser, this was not something we
organized. This was something our supporters organized by themselves. As long as
that tendency continues, then we will be in a position where it will be
extremely hard for the US to act.
